Support
-------

Nuvola Apps Alpha mode of [Nuvola Player](https://github.com/tiliado/nuvolaplayer) is an
experimental feature and comes with no support for now. We hope to improve this situation when
[project funding](https://tiliado.eu/nuvolaplayer/funding/) gets better.

Installation
------------

  * Execute ``make help`` to get help.
  * Execute ``make build`` to build graphics.
  * Execute ``make install`` to install files to user's local directory.
  * Don't execute ``make uninstall``. Why would you do that?
