This is an Easter Egg for Nuvola Player 3, so it isn't shown in the services selector dialog,
but you have to launch it from terminal: ``nuvolaplayer3 -a google_calendar``

 * Propagates web app alerts (e.g. calendar event notifications) as desktop notifications.
 * Opens external links in your default web browser.
 * Tray icon support.
